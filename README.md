# COVID-19-Question-Answering-System
I implemented a model in this project that will be generalizable to new questions, and it won't be limited to specific keys. So we use the modern machine learning models called Question Answering models that integrated transformers.
As the Covid article dataset is too large, our purpose was to build a model that can almost answer most of the questions related to Covid among these versatile articles.
I use this considerable dataset as a context to fine-tune language models and extract our favorable answers from them. After reviewing cuttin-edge methods in the field, we decided that the Roberta-Squad model and Biober-model, which are both Bert-Basd models, can be a desirable solution to our problem.
